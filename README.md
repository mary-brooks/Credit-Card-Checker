# 💳 Credit Card Checker
Credit Card Checker is a challenge project from Codecademy's Front End Engineer Career Path. It is a JavaScript program that validates credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm, identifies invalid card numbers, and returns the credit card companies that may have issued them. The starter code included 15 arrays: 5 valid credit card numbers, 5 invalid credit card numbers, and 5 undetermined, and a nested array of these 15 arrays.
